# react-spreadsheet

To get myself a little more up to speed with modern React, and Preact, this is
an example of a simple spreadsheet web application from the book
[React: Up & Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042266.do), but
expanded upon:

* Added a Babel + Webpack bundling workflow.
* Refactored to use ECMAScript 6 classes.
* Converted to Preact with preact-compat.

Here's how to get it running:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
